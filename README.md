## About The Project
This Pac-Man game is a simple yet engaging recreation of the classic arcade game. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on dynamic board generation, character movement, and score tracking. The motivation behind this project was to apply fundamental programming concepts and create an interactive web-based game.

   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Approach
This project was an educational venture into game development with web technologies. It was developed in pairs as a part of a coursework assignment. The game does not use advanced frameworks like React but relies on vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript for implementation.

The development began with constructing the game board through a matrix representation, allowing dynamic rendering of walls, dots, the player, and ghosts. The main challenge was managing the game's state and rendering updates based on player and ghost movements, which were handled through manipulating the DOM and updating object states accordingly. Ghost movements are randomized due to time constraints, but the architecture supports adding or removing ghosts dynamically. The player's movement is controlled through keyboard inputs, with speed limitations imposed to simulate a more natural gameplay experience.

## Status
- The project is in a completed state but open to enhancements, especially in ghost AI and adding more levels.

## Credits
- This project was developed as part of the ITC course curriculum. Special thanks to my project partner and our course instructors for their guidance.
