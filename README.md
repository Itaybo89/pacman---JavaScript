## About The Project
PokeTank is a web-based game inspired by the classic strategy artillery game Pocket Tanks. It was developed using React for the UI, JavaScript for game logic, and Phaser for rendering the game. The game allows players to control a tank, adjust the barrel angle, and select from different explosive types to hit the enemy tank. The game features a dynamic map, and tanks can move and adjust their shooting angles according to the terrain. The objective is to defeat the enemy tank before it reaches you.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- JavaScript
- Phaser
- HTML/CSS for styling

## Setup / Installation
To set up and run PokeTank locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Itaybo89/PokeTank---React-Phaser.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd PokeTank---React-Phaser
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The game should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Approach
The development of PokeTank was influenced by my previous experience with game development in Unity, which helped in designing the game's classes, such as Shell and Tank. The game's map is generated dynamically to adjust the tank's position and angles based on the terrain, mimicking real-life tank mechanics. The player's UI displays the barrel angle adjusted to the terrain and allows for the selection of different explosives, each with varying propulsion forces. The project was a solo endeavor completed within a week as part of the ITC course curriculum, focusing on applying game development concepts using web technologies.

## Status
- The project is in a completed state, with future enhancements planned for enemy AI and additional levels.

## Credits
- This project was developed by me as part of an assignment for the ITC course. Special thanks to the course instructors for their support and guidance.
